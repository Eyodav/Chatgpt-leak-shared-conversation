# üîç ChatGPT Leak Shared Conversation

This project uses targeted Dorks (don't work with Google) to uncover publicly shared ChatGPT conversations that may expose sensitive data or internal documents.
This issue occurs because search engines index shared ChatGPT conversations, making them publicly accessible.

## üìå Summary

Some users unknowingly share public ChatGPT conversations containing sensitive data such as:

- API keys, tokens, passwords
- Configuration variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `smtp_password`, etc.)
- Internal documents and procedures
- Employee names, emails, and org charts

These findings are accessible without authentication and can be leveraged for OSINT or as part of a bug bounty report.

## üí° Example Dorks

`site:chatgpt.com/share intext:"api_key"`  
`site:chatgpt.com/share intext:"apiKey"`  
`site:chatgpt.com/share intext:"Authorization: Bearer"`
